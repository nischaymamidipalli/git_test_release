Downtime Request - Changing system temp files path for the LS Box - Biglots Preprod

VOtmmAzTyvN@p}x

Hello Team,

As we are in a process of changing the path of system temp for the LS box which is basically  pointed to c drive. Whenever we are performing operations like taking backup, FTBR's etc. It is  downloading temp files to the drives whichever we have configured in the system temp ( c drive), which won't have sufficient space to download the files and eventually the operation will fail. Due to this we are pointing the system temp files path to a higher disk so that it will have sufficient space to download the data. After changing the path, we would be restarting the install agent which will cause issues, if in case any restorations are going on.  Hence, we would recommend not to perform any operations as such during the downtime window.  For this process we would require a 1 hour of downtime during weekdays. Kindly let us know.
